    <p>
        A little over 80 years ago, humanity first began broadcasting radio and television signals with enough power that they should leave Earth’s atmosphere and progress deep into interstellar space. If someone living in a distant star system were keeping a vigilant eye out for these signals, they would not only be able to pick them up, but immediately identify them as created by an intelligent species. In 1960, Frank Drake first proposed searching for such signals from other star systems by using large radio dishes, giving rise to SETI: the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. Yet over the past half-century, we’ve developed far more efficient ways to communicate across the globe than with broadcast radio and TV signals. Does searching for aliens in the electromagnetic spectrum even make sense anymore?
    </p>
    <p>
        This question, of course, is extraordinarily speculative, but gives us a chance to look at our own technological progress, and to consider how that might play out elsewhere in the Universe. After all, if someone from a culture that was versed only in smoke signals and drum beats found themselves deep inside the heart of a forest, they might conclude that there was no intelligent life around. Yet if you gave them a cellphone, there’s a good chance they could get reception from right where they stood! Our conclusions may be as biased as the methods we apply.
    </p>

    <p>The mechanism of electricity only began to be understood in the late 18th century, with the work of Ben Franklin. The power of electricity only began to be harnessed to run electric circuits and other powered devices during the 19th century, and the phenomena associated with classical electromagnetism only became understood through the latter half of that century. The first transmissions of electromagnetic signals for communication didn’t take place until 1895, and the power of radio broadcasts to extend far out into interplanetary and interstellar space wasn’t achieved until the 1930s.</p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/blog/assets/images/space_three.jpg" alt="This image, current in 2011 (and now 7 years out of date), shows the reach of humanity’s radio signals in space. A light year is a long distance, but the stars in our galaxy are tens of thousands of light years away, on average. Image credit: Abstruse Goose.">
    <p>The speed of light is quite a limiting thing as well: if our radio signals have been traveling through interstellar space for 80 years, that means that only civilizations within 80 light years of us would have had an opportunity to receive those signals, and that only civilizations within 40 light years would have had the opportunity to receive those signals and send something back to us that we would’ve received by now. If the Fermi Paradox is the question of “where is everyone,” the answer is, “not within 40 light years of us,” which doesn’t tell us very much about intelligent life in the Universe at all.

        <br>
        While there might be hundreds of billions of stars within our galaxy alone, and around two trillion galaxies in the observable Universe, there are less than 1,000 stars within 40 light years of Earth.
    </p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="/blog/assets/images/space_four.jpg" alt="There are a few dozen stars within 14 light years of Earth; that number rises up to only about 1000 after 40 light years, which is close to the maximum round-trip time of a light signal sent from Earth by humans capable of reaching out into the Universe.

    <p>
        And to make matters worse, electromagnetic signals going out from Earth into interstellar space are decreasing, not increasing. Television and radio broadcasts are increasingly being run through cables or via satellite, not from transmission towers here on Earth. By time another century passes, it’s very likely that the signals we sent out (and hence, began looking for) during the 20th century will cease to be emitted from Earth altogether. Perhaps an alien civilization, making note of these observations when the signals do arrive, would draw the conclusion that this blue, watery planet orbiting our star in the great distance actually achieved intelligent, technologically advance life for a short while, and then wiped ourselves out as the signals gradually stopped.
        <br/>
        Or, perhaps, drawing conclusions from what is or isn’t present in any form of electromagnetic signal is altogether wrongheaded.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we were to look at Earth from a nearby distance in visible light, there would be no doubts about the fact of whether or not it’s inhabited: the great glow of cities at night is unmistakably a sign of our activity. Yet this light pollution is relatively new, and is something we’re finally learning how to manage and control if we put the effort (i.e., time, money, manpower and resources) into it. There’s no reason not to be optimistic that by the end of the 21st or 22nd centuries, the Earth at night will look no different than it did for billions of years: dark, except for the occasional aurora, lightning storm or erupting volcano.

    <p>But if we weren’t looking for electromagnetic signals, what would we look at? Indeed, everything in the known Universe is limited by the speed of light, and any signal created on another world would necessitate that we be able to observe it. These signals — in terms of what could reach us — fall into four categories:

        <ol>
        <li>Electromagnetic signals, which include any form of light of any wavelength that would indicate the presence of intelligent life.</li>
        <li>Gravitational wave signals, which, if there is one unique to intelligent life, would be detectable with sensitive enough equipment anywhere in the Universe.</li>
        <li>Neutrino signals, which — although incredibly low in flux at great distances — would have an unmistakable signature dependent on the reaction that created them.</li>
        <li>And finally, actual, macroscopic space probes, either robotic, computerized, free-floating or inhabited, which made its way towards Earth.</li>
        <li>How remarkable that our science-fiction imaginations focus almost exclusively on the fourth possibility, which is by far the least likely!</li>
    </ol>
